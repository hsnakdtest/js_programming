/*
 Java       : uses a compiler to translate the entire source code into bytecode before execution.
 JavaScript : uses an interpreter to read and execute code line by line at runtime.
 Differences:
    - Java is compiled, JavaScript is interpreted.
    - Java code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM); JavaScript runs in browsers or environments like Node.js.
    - Java needs to be compiled before execution; JavaScript runs immediately.
    - Java shows all syntax errors at compile time; JavaScript shows errors during runtime.
    - Java is generally faster after compilation; JavaScript may be slower due to real-time interpretation.
